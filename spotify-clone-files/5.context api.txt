(see fig 2.component tree)

.as you can see we have <App/> comp,
 inside it we have <Player/>, <Login/> comp,
 inside <Player/> comp we have <Header/>, <SideBar> comp.
 inside <SideBar> we have other nested small component

.so all this component required user info

.we have access user info in <App/> component

.so we use 'Context-Api'.

.we pass user info from <App/> to its child component

.so with the help of context-api this info is available to all of its nested child component
